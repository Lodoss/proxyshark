*THIS PAGE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION*

This document is based on the development version and should be considered as a technical specification document. As a consequence, some features could be absent from the last stable release and could be marked as _deprecated_ or _upcoming_ in the following documentation. See the [ChangeLog changelog] for details.

== Arguments ==

To run proxyshark, simply run the Python script _proxyshark.py_. You can use the following arguments:

==== `-h | --help` ====

 Print a help message describing the available command-line arguments.

==== `-v | --verbose [DEPRECATED]` ====

 Turn on verbose output. Can be specified twice for debugging mode.

 _Deprecated_: verbose output is now enabled by default, a log file _proxyshark.log_ is also created at startup. `[UPCOMING]`

==== `-q | --queue-num <queue-num>` ====

 Select a netfilter queue. Default is _0_.

==== `-t | --tshark-binary <tshark-binary>` ====

 Set the path to the tshark binary. Default is _bin/arch/tshark_ where _arch_ is the current architecture (_x86_64_, _armv7l_, etc). You can get your current architecture by running _uname -m_.

==== `-w | --web-ui [UPCOMING]` ====

 Enable the web-based interface. Default is command-line interface.

==== `-a | --bind-address <bind-address> [UPCOMING]` ====

 Set the bind address of the web server. Default is _127.0.0.1_.

==== `-p | --port <port> [UPCOMING]` ====

 Set the listening port of the web server. Default is _80_.

==== Examples ====

 To run proxyshark in command-line mode:

 {{{
 python proxyshark.py
 }}}

 To run proxyshark on queue 123 in web-based mode and port 8080:

 {{{
 python proxyshark.py -q 123 -w -p 8080
 }}}

== Command-line interface `[UPCOMING]` ==

The command-line interface allows the user to setup filters and to interactively manipulate the captured packets.

Several commands are available:

==== `h | help [command]` ====

 Print a help message describing the available commands. You can specify an optional command name to get information about a specific command.

==== `i | info` ====

 Print information about the current program state:
  * capture status
  * BPF filter and netfilter rules
  * applicative filters
  * breakpoints
  * statistics

 See the [TechnicalDescription#Packet_filtering technical description] for details about BPF filters, netfilter rules, applicative filters and breakpoints.

==== `c | capture [bpf-filter]` ====

 Start a new capture. The argument will be parsed as a BPF filter and converted into a set of netfilter rules, redirecting the matching packets to the selected netfilter queue. If no argument is given, continue the current capture. See the [TechnicalDescription#Packet_filtering technical description] for details about BPF filters and netfilter rules.

==== `p | pause [bpf-filter]`====

 Pause the current capture on the next packet. If no capture is currently running, start a new one using the BPF filter given in argument, then break on the first captured packet. See the [TechnicalDescription#Packet_filtering technical description] for details about BPF filters and netfilter rules.

==== `s | stop` ====

 Stop the current running capture.

==== `f | filter[s] [filter-expression]` ====

 Create a new applicative filter based on the given expression. If no argument is given, print the existing filters. See the [TechnicalDescription#Packet_filtering technical description] for details about applicative filters.

==== `b | breakpoint[s] [filter-expression]` ====

 Create a new breakpoint based on the given expression. If no argument is given, print the existing breakpoints. See the [TechnicalDescription#Breakpoints technical description] for details about breakpoints.

==== `d | delete <type> <id>` ====

 Delete a filter or a breakpoint. The type can be _f_ or _filter_ for a filter and _b_ or _breakpoint_ for a breakpoint. The id must be a valid identifier returned by the _filter_ or _breakpoint_ commands.

==== `e | exec <filter-id> <python-code>` ====

 Define the piece of code to be executed when a given filter is triggered. The filter-id must be a valid identifier returned by the _filter_ command.

==== `pkt | packet` ====

 The last dissected packet.

==== `proto | protocol[s]` ====

 List of the protocols of the last dissected packet.

==== `field[s]` ====

 List of the fields of the last dissected packet.

==== `accept` ====

 Accept the current packet (including your modifications).

==== `drop` ====

 Drop the current packet and continue the current capture.
