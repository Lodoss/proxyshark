*THIS PAGE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION*

This document is based on the development version and should be considered as a technical specification document. As a consequence, some features could be absent from the last stable release and could be marked as _deprecated_ or _forthcoming_ in the following documentation. See the [ChangeLog changelog] for details.

== Arguments ==

To run proxyshark, simply run the Python script _proxyshark.py_ with the following arguments:

==== `-h | --help` ====

 Print a help message describing the available command-line arguments.

==== `-v | --verbose [DEPRECATED]` ====

 Turn on verbose output. Can be specified twice for debugging mode.

 _Deprecated_: verbose output is now enabled by default, a clean _proxyshark.log_ will be automatically created at startup.

==== `-q | --queue-num <queue-num>` ====

 Select a netfilter queue. Default is _0_.

==== `-t | --tshark-binary <tshark-binary>` ====

 Set the path of the tshark binary. Default is _bin/arch/tshark_ where _arch_ is the current architecture (_x86_64_, _armv7l_, etc). You can get your current architecture by running _uname -m_.

==== `-w | --web-ui [FORTHCOMING]` ====

 Enable the web-based interface. Default is command-line interface.

==== `-a | --bind-address <bind-address> [FORTHCOMING]` ====

 Set the bind address of the web server. Default is _127.0.0.1_.

==== `-p | --port <port> [FORTHCOMING]` ====

 Set the listening port of the web server. Default is _80_.

==== Examples ====

 To run proxyshark in command-line mode:

 {{{
 python proxyshark.py
 }}}

 To run proxyshark on queue 123 in web-based mode and port 8080:

 {{{
 python proxyshark.py -q 123 -w -p 8080
 }}}

== Command-line interface `[FORTHCOMING]` ==

The command-line interface allows the user to setup filters and to interactively manipulate the captured packets.

Several commands are available:

==== `h | help [command]` ====

 Print a help message describing the available commands. You can specify an optional command name to get information about a specific command.

==== `i | info [type]` ====

 Print information about the current program state. You can pass one of the following arguments to get information about a specific element:
  * _c_ or _capture_ for BPF filter and netfilter rules
  * _f_ or _filter_ for tshark filters
  * _b_ or _breakpoints_ for breakpoints

==== `c | capture <bpf-filter>` ====

 Start a new capture. The argument will be parsed as a BPF filter and converted into a set of netfilter rules, redirecting the matching packets to the selected netfilter queue.

 See the [TechnicalDescription#Packet_filtering technical description] for details about BPF filters and netfilter rules.

==== `p | pause [bpf-filter]`====

 Pause the current capture on the next captured packet. If no capture is currently running, start a new one using the BPF filter past in argument and break on the first captured packet.

 See the [TechnicalDescription#Packet_filtering technical description] for details about BPF filters and netfilter rules.

==== `s | stop` ====

 Stop the current running capture.

==== `f | filter [tshark-filter]` ====

 Create a new applicative filter based on the given tshark expression. If no argument is given, create a new filter based on the TCP/UDP/ICMP layer of the current packet. Otherwise, this command is equivalent to _info filter_.

 See the [TechnicalDescription#Packet_filtering technical description] for details about applicative filters.

==== `b | breakpoint [tshark-filter]` ====
