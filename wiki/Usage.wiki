 ==== Examples ====

 To run proxyshark in command-line mode:

 {{{
 python proxyshark.py
 }}}

 To run proxyshark on queue 123 in web-based mode and port 8080:

== Command-line interface ==

The command-line interface allows the user to setup capture filters and to interactively manipulate the captured packets.

 ==== `h | help [command]` ====

 Print a help message describing the available commands. You can pass an optional command name as an argument to get some help about a specific command.

 ==== `info` ====

 Print a brief status about what proxyshark is doing:
  * General BPF filter
  * List of enabled TShark filters
  * List of enabled breakpoints

 ==== `info r | info run` ====

 Print the BPF filter and !NetFilter rules that are currently used to capture packets.

 ==== `info f | info filter[s] <pattern>` ====
