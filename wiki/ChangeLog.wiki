==== `==` v0.1 (2010-10-07) `==` ====

 * Very first version of proxyshark!
 * Netfilter rules must be written manually:
  * `iptables -I OUTPUT 1 -d 1.2.3.4 -p tcp --dport 80 -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0`
  * `iptables -I INPUT 1 -s 1.2.3.4 -p tcp --sport 80 -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0`
 * Packets can be accepted or dropped but you have to call the functions by yourself
 * Packets are read-only, hmm not really but there is no API to modify them directly
 * Packets are dissected and printed to stdout by default
 * You must iterate manually over each protocols and fields to find a given item...
 * No command-line interface
 * No web-based interface
 * Use _-h_ for help
