== Packet filtering ==

There are 2 levels of filtering in proxyshark:
 * The first one is implemented in netfilter. It is based on the BPF filter past to the _capture_ or _pause_ commands.
 * The second one acts at an applicative level. It allows you to define filtering rules based on the protocols and fields detected by the dissection engine.
