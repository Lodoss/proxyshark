"Dumpcap can be installed with the set-user-id bit set, so members of the "
"\"wireshark\" system group will have the privileges required to use it. This "
"way of capturing packets using Wireshark/Tshark is recommended over the "
"alternative of running them directly as superuser, because less of the code "
"will run with elevated privileges."
