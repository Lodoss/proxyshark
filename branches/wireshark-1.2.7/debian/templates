_Description: Should dumpcap be installed "setuid root"?
 Dumpcap can be installed with the set-user-id bit set, so members of
 the "wireshark" system group will have the privileges required to use it.
 This way of capturing packets using Wireshark/Tshark is recommended
 over the alternative of running them directly as superuser, because
 less of the code will run with elevated privileges.
 .
 Enabling this feature may be a security risk, so it is disabled by
 default. If in doubt, it is suggested to leave it disabled.
