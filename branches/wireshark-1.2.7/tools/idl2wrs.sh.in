#  This file is a simple shell script wrapper for the IDL to 
#  Wireshark dissector code.
#
#  ie: wireshark_be.py and wireshark_gen.py
#
#  This file is used to generate "Wireshark" dissectors from IDL descriptions. 
#  The output language generated is "C". It will generate code to use the 
#  GIOP/IIOP get_CDR_XXX API.
#
#  Please see packet-giop.h in Wireshark distro for API description.
#  Wireshark is available at http://www.wireshark.org/
